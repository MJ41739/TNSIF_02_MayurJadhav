        JSPM began its humble journey under the visionary leadership of Dr. (Prof.) T. J. Sawant in 2001 with the establishment of Rajarshi Shahu College of Engineering at Tathawade. Today JSPM is an agglomerate of more than 70 Institutes spread across Six campuses providing quality education ranging from Pre-School to Doctoral Research for over 50000+ students in the metropolitan region of Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.

        Armed with the vision of making higher education available and affordable to all those who are desirous of pursuing it, JSPM has in a short span expanded itself into a major education provider across Maharashtra. Along the way JSPM has also acquired two more education trusts<em> The Shetkari Shikshan Mandal and Shri Bhagwant Education and Research Charitable Trust Barshi.</em>
